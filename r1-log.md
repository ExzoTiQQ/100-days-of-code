# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Yaroslav Afenkin]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 - Jan 1, 2018

Done with the first day. Mostly was getting familiar with the python syntax. Going a bit tough, had to google a lot of basic things. Also absence of curly braces... Well, I'll get used to it soon I think.
Have no ideas for the projects right now, but I'll come up with something.

### R1D2 - Jan 2, 2018

Started early today. Managed to finish Codecademy python course. Covered OOP, file input and output, a topic called "Advanced Topics in Python", featuring bitwise operations, lambda expressions, and methods on lists and dictionaries. Was quite easy for me, as I know how things work from JS. Also had a bit of math stuff in terms of the course.
Later managed to solve a problem on [Binary Search Trees](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-search-trees/problem) and [Ransom Note](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ransom-note/problem) using JS. More than 8 hours of coding today in total.

### R1D3 - Jan 3, 2018

Been learning D3js in terms of The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy. Going hard. Discouraging. 4 hours of it literally destroyed me. Taking rest and will go on tomorrow.

### R1D4 - Jan 4, 2018
Managed to go through D3 data joins and basic of svg in terms of the course described in day 3.

### R1D5 - Jan 5, 2018

Started with SVG stuff today, covered the rest of the material, did couple of exercises to make sure I'm comfortable with SVG basics. Then moved to D3. Now I can draw fancy SVG graphs. Well, now that fancy at the moment, but I'll get there soon!

### R1D6 - Jan 6, 2018

Didn't have much free time today, though I still managed to solve couple of issues on Hackerrank.com concerning linked lists. Gonna have more time tomorrow.

### R1D7 - Jan 7, 2018

Today learned to draw fancy scatterplot graphs and to make my graphs overall more informative. It took me a lot of time today to figure out how things work under the hood. Still not sure if I understood everything. But I'll get there soon. Gotta finish D3 part of the course tomorrow.

### R1D8 - Jan 8, 2018

I continue learning D3. Today I got acquainted with histograms. Quite hard stuff, coding part is very confusing. But the result is worth it. After today's practice I enjoy D3 even more. Piecharts tomorrow, hopefully.

### R1D9 - Jan 9, 2018

Today I deployed a node/express/mongo app for my father's business via heroku. Also did some minor changed on the app. It took me more time than I expected, because it was my first time. Then I still managed to learn d3 pie charts. I didn't cover all the desired material today, though still had a good portion. Pie charts are easier than histograms in terms of code.

### R1D10 - Jan 10, 2018

Did some node coding along the day, still improving some parts of the app I deployed yesterday. Solved 4 challenges on hackerrank in terms of their "30 days of code" challenge.

### R1D11 - Jan 11, 2018

Today I managed to finish d3 pie charts. Feeling confident building them. Also covered d3 async stuff and d3 transitions, though still have to practice with those. Also doing a lot of node app maintenance, i.e. adding some new functionality and fixing some issues.

### R1D12 - Jan 12, 2018

Going to Warsaw by bus. Have very poor internet connection. Managed to create a complete 15 puzzle using pure JS. It's alsways good to refresh basic things in memory.

### R1D13 - Jan 13, 2018

Not many things done today. Feeling tired after 29 hour trip. Managed to review d3 material. Now feeling more confident with d3 async methods and transitions. Also covered d3 tooltips today.

### R1D14 - Jan 14, 2018

Covered geoJson, topoJson d3 stuff. Have built some fancy maps in terms of udemy course exercises. Also covered force-directed graphs. All this stuff is confusing as hell, but it allows to build cool things. Tomorrow last section dedicated to d3 and I'm moving to React, finally.
