### R1D1 - Jan 1, 2018

Done with the first day. Mostly was getting familiar with the python syntax. Going a bit tough, had to google a lot of basic things. Also absence of curly braces... Well, I'll get used to it soon I think.
Have no ideas for the projects right now, but I'll come up with something.
