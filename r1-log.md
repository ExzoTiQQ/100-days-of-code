## Log

### R1D1 - Jan 1, 2018

Done with the first day. Mostly was getting familiar with the python syntax. Going a bit tough, had to google a lot of basic things. Also absence of curly braces... Well, I'll get used to it soon I think.
Have no ideas for the projects right now, but I'll come up with something.

### R1D2 - Jan 2, 2018

Started early today. Managed to finish Codecademy python course. Covered OOP, file input and output, a topic called "Advanced Topics in Python", featuring bitwise operations, lambda expressions, and methods on lists and dictionaries. Was quite easy for me, as I know how things work from JS. Also had a bit of math stuff in terms of the course.
Later managed to solve a problem on [Binary Search Trees](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-search-trees/problem) and [Ransom Note](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ransom-note/problem) using JS. More than 8 hours of coding today in total.

### R1D3 - Jan 3, 2018

Been learning D3js in terms of The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy. Going hard. Discouraging. 4 hours of it literally destroyed me. Taking rest and will go on tomorrow.

### R1D4 - Jan 4, 2018
Managed to go through D3 data joins and basic of svg in terms of the course described in day 3.
